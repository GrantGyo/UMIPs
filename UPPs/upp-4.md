## Summary

This UPP will remove SGT & DSD from the collateral currency whitelist introduced in [UMIP-8](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-8.md). 

## Rationale

## Delisting DSD

DSD was approved as a collateral currency in [UMIP-36](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-36.md] and has since been far below the 1$ peg, and with a daily volume of less than $10k it isnâ€™t suitable as a collateral currency. 

## Delisting SGT

SGT was approved as a collateral currency in [UMIP-96](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/UMIPs/blob/master/UMIPs/umip-96].md, liquidity has since dropped massively which is a concern for $UMA token holders since collateral liquidity is an important factor in determining whether a collateral currency is approved or rejected. This makes SGT an unsuitable collateral currency.
